    This is the service manager API. It is an extension of the the Open Service Broker API. The Open Service Broker 
    API defines the contract between the a requesting client and the service broker. The broker is expected to 
    implement several HTTP (or HTTPS) endpoints underneath a URI prefix. One or more services can be provided by a 
    single broker, and load balancing enables horizontal scalability of redundant brokers. Multiple service provider 
    instances can be supported by a single broker using different URL prefixes and credentials. [Learn more about 
    the Service Broker API.] (https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/). Note the [topic on orphan reso
    lution](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/_spec.md#orphans). It is not 
    dealt with in this spec.
