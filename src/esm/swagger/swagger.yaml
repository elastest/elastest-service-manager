  description: "This is the service manager API. It is an extension of the the Open\
    \ Service Broker API (v2.12). The Open Service Broker API defines the contract\
    \ between the a requesting client and the service broker. The broker is expected\
    \ to implement several HTTP (or HTTPS) endpoints underneath a URI prefix. One\
    \ or more services can be provided by a single broker, and load balancing enables\
    \ horizontal scalability of redundant brokers. Multiple service provider instances\
    \ can be supported by a single broker using different URL prefixes and credentials.\
    \ [Learn more about the Service Broker API.] (https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/).\
    \ Note the [topic on orphan resolution](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/_spec.md#orphans).\
