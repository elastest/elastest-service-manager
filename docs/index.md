# elastest-service-manager (esm)

## Features

The service manager is based around the idea of delivering service instances to end-user consumers in an efficient and easy way to present their software to the service manager.
For this, the ElasTest Service Manager supports deployment using docker-compose descriptions and will soon support kubernetes-based descriptions.

In order to use the facility of the the ElasTest Service Manager one must use its API which is based upon the 2.12 version of the Open Service Broker API, and from which there are some specific ElasTest extensions added. 

## API Features

The following features are currently supported:

 * OSBA: list the contents of the service catalog.
 * OSBA: create a service instance.
 * OSBA: delete a service instance.
 * ElasTest Extension: get details on a service instance.
 * ElasTest Extension: register a service in the service catalog.
 * ElasTest Extension: register a service manifest (docker-compose, OpenShift/K8s[planned]) associated with a service description.

### API Features to be Implemented

The following features will be supported in upcoming releases:

 * OSBA: update a service instance

## User Documentation
Please refer to the [user docs](user-doc.md).

## Development Documentation
Please refer to the [development docs](dev-doc.md).

## Service Providers Usage

If you wish to use the ESM to deliver service instances of your software you need the following:

* All software components packaged as services within docker images.
* Those images should be available in an image registry that is accessible by the ESM
* A description of how those docker images are composed. Currently only the docker-compose/docker-swarm format is supported. Kubernetes will be supported through the use of Helm templates.

Once these items are available then the service provider simply needs to:

* Register the service with the ESM's catalog
* Register the service manifest with the ESM
