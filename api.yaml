  title: ElasTest Service Manager API
  description: >
    This is the service manager API. It is an extension of the the Open Service Broker API
    (v2.12). The Open Service Broker API defines the contract between the a requesting client
    and the service broker. The broker is expected to implement
    several HTTP (or HTTPS) endpoints underneath a URI prefix. One or more
    services can be provided by a single broker, and load balancing enables
    horizontal scalability of redundant brokers. Multiple service provider instances
    can be supported by a single broker using different URL prefixes and
    credentials. [Learn more about the Service Broker API.]
    (https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/).
    Note the [topic on orphan resolution](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/_spec.md#orphans). It is not dealt with in this spec.
